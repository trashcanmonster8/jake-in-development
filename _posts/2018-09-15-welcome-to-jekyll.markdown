### Welcome! ###

Yes, another developer's personal blog and websites. But in reality, it's easier to show skills than to talk about them. But for sincerity's sake and for clarity's sake, this blog is to document my work and reflections in the field of Automation.

### Where I have come from ###

Originally I was a math and science teacher for grades 7 to 12. I did this for over five years. After the birth of my second child and being diagnosis with a stage 1 seminoma (it did get to stage 2... but that was after my transition and I am cured now), that career became too much. So I started to learn how to build software.

My first attempt at a [website](https://jake-in-development.weebly.com/) and some of my first projects. Hopefully weeby doesn't take it down. Its nice to see how far I've come.

I got an opportunity to work in Test Automation at Nationwide Insurace Company in December 2016. I got the opportunity to write automated test scripts for angular applications, API's, and SOAP webservices. There is a lot I learned during that time which I hope to discuss as I put this together. I am currently still at Nationwide standing up new automation suites on teams with no prior automation frameworks.

### Purpose of this Site ###

To create a portfolio of work for my professional development and career. I want to have my work on display as resources for other people searching the web. Selfishly, I hope someone at Google or Amazon is really impressed and wants to hire me. But as I had mentioned earlier, its easier to show something than to claim something.
