## The Resistance ##

Sometimes what gets most in the way of automation is not the skill, the money, or business lack of understanding. The later of the three I believe is less true than we often complain about. Sometimes though, the biggest resistence to automation is buy-in from practiioners.

I have recently moved teams as a Test Automation Developer. Previously I had created automation against a front-end website and a couple of RESTful API's. I was familiar with page objects, cucumber, Jenkins integration, and started to write Java code and create unit tests. But having this be my only exposure to automation, it was time to jump into someting new.

This team was sold on automation as a best practice. I felt very blessed to have started on a team that valued this effort and valued the work I was doing for the team. But I found that this new team didn't exactly share this enthusiasm for automation.

So I got offered a position to stand up automation in against an application that routes information from a caller to a customer service representative in a call center. Not HTTP, not REST, required a GUI, this application was a Windows application that required interaction with a UI. This also required grabbing data from a database, though I am still not entirely sure how that all works yet. I have only been on this team for three days.

Sitting in a meeting on BDD, I knew that this was the best way for us to create automation, build new features, and move towards DevOps. It was in this meeting that one of our manual testers spoke up and said, "Well there are a lot of these things that cannot be automated. When we have tried, we get these timeout issues! So how are we to do BDD when we can't automate." The last sentence was implied in her tone and non-verbal resistence (or maybe that was just me being defensive).

I am not why she seems opposed to automation. I have been told various possible reasons. But it only matters as context in which to help move the team to greater maturity and faster releases. I am certain from her perspective, her points are valid.

## Resistance is Futile ##

The ultimate problem is that in order for any company or any application to survive, it must automate as much as possible. There are numerous examples from The DevOps Handbook about companies that changed and kept pace. I remember a slde from a presentation that showed companies that accepted DevOp principles; companies like Amazon, Google, Etsy, etc... The next slide was a list of companies that did not accept DevOp principles; companies like HP or Xerox. The later where monoliths of their day in which they may be stuck.

We see the benefits specfically about automated testing from the Google Webservice group from the DevOp's handbook.

Furthermore I have leadership support and support for the scrum master to automate everything that I can.

## Resistance is an Opportunity ##

Resistance is not always a bad thing. It exists for a reason and thus its existence exposes attitudes. It is hard to avoid the question, "Why are you so resistant to this idea?" when one is expressing resistance. So it offers a chance to have the conversation to alleviate concerns, uplift resources into new technologies, and promtes best practices across the organization. Conversely, not handling resistance does not stop it but could increase it or have bad consequences for someone.

Resistance is a change to get "buy in". Maybe the reason for the resistance is that they are not sold on the idea being presented. Maybe they have some good arguments that the new idea needs to consider. Maybe they have been considered and its a chance to reason through those arguments. But these conversations are worth having to remove the resistance.

Resistance is a chance to teach and uplift. Maybe the resistance is due to insecurity about the skills needed for the new change. In my world, the manual testers felt they don't have the skills to do automated testing. One of my hopes is to find a role for their skills and slowly introduce them to coding and automation skills. As they see small successes, hopefully they can see a way for them to participate in the change.

Resistance is a chance to promote new tools as benefits for the individuals and the organization. In the new push for automation, this will remove a lot of the routine and monotonous work that takes time and quite frankly isn't fun. So we can improve the effectiveness and experience of their work. But maybe these folks like monotoneny. I guess there isn't much to say about that in the modern age where new things are developed and released daily.

The alternative to viewing resistance in these ways results only in further resistance. In any case, resistance must be confronted, even if it be gently. To avoid it or skirt around the issues only promotes more resistance, maybe it stays the same level of resistance at best. When resistance increases, breaking points occur. This situation can be avoided by the above. In this case, resistance to new automated approaches to software testing will result in the resistance losing their jobs. This outcome I don't want for them as many are late in their careers.

## Conclusion ##

We must take on resistance with hope that change is possible. This is an opportunity to help change mindsets and improve productivity. Furthermore in software, change is always happening. So in a way **"Resistance is futile"** in any case. So might as well help the change for others.
