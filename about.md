â€‹I have a passion for mathematics, physics, and problem solving. I love learning about logic and the world. I wanted to give that to others through education.

But now I have found a new pathway to fulfill my passions in software development and cloud infrastructure. This site is a project to learn and demonstrate these skills.

This site is developed on [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
