## About Me ##

â€‹I have a passion for mathematics, physics, and problem solving. I love learning about logic and the world. I wanted to give that to others through education. I started as a math and science teacher between 7th and 12th grades. After 5 years of teaching and after having my second child, I decided to focus my life on developing my own children.

But now I have found a new pathway to fulfill my passions for problem solving in software development and cloud infrastructure. This site is a project to learn and demonstrate these skills.

## The Site ##

This blog is a repository of my current work and reflections in software development. I plan to demonstrate my current skills in coding and continous integration through kata's and code snippets. I expect to regularly post my reflections on current readings and experiences in the field. And I hope to provide a place for you to know about me.
